# leatherstrap
A php framework for generating HTML pages using bootstrap.
## What Is Leatherstrap?
Leatherstrap is a framework that allows PHP developers to easily create full functioning websites and webapps by building an HTML page as a PHP object instead of concatenating endless strings of HTML inside of their PHP code.
## Why Is This Needed?
HTML Isn't hard to learn. Most, if not all, of web developers would be able to complete their projects without the use of this library. However, they would spend more time worrying about closing tags than actually writing back end code. Leatherstrap allows developers to create pages as objects, allowing them to write cleaner code, and spend more time doing it.
## Bootstrap
Leatherstrap is build on top of bootstrap, meaning every page generated by Leatherstrap will be beautiful, clean, and mobile friendly.
